Networks are objects made of nodes and links. The links connect the nodes.
Networks can be bipartite, i.e. the nodes can be of two different types and
one type can only be linked with the second one. Links can also be weighted. 

Site-species matrices can be viewed as bipartite networks where sites and
species are two different classes of nodes, and the occurrences of species
within sites are the links.

The community detection algorithms try to identify the communities of nodes
that interact more with each other than the network as a whole. Appling these
algorithms to site-species matrices is therefore equivalent to the more classic
bioregionalization methods.

The optimal community partition of a network can be found by searching for the 
partition that maximizes a metric called modularity. Maximising the modularity
is a computationally hard problem requiring the use of algorithms.

Network theory offers plenty of such algorithms to classify nodes that are more
connected than expected randomly based or not on the modularity. With the 
`bioregion` R package, we cover the main network algorithms to identify 
bioregions in site-species matrices. All functions relying on network algorithms
start with the prefix `netclu_`.

Network clustering takes place on the left-hand size part of the `bioregion`
conceptual diagram:

In total, we have 9 functions, which can be classified like this:

This vignette aims at briefly explaining how each algorithm and its associated
`bioregion` function works.
For this purpose, we use the European freshwater fish dataset that comes with
`bioregion`.

# Introduction
## Input data

All network algorithms work with the network format, i.e. a `data.frame` with
3 columns: sites, species and the abundance of a given species in a given site.
This type of object can be obtained from a site x species matrix through the
use of `mat_to_net()`.

In this vignette, we directly load the network format for the distribution of
fish in European basins.

```{r}
library("bioregion")
data("fishdf")
```

Some network algorithms work with the similarity matrix between each pair of
sites.

```{r}
data("fishmat")
fish_simil <- similarity(fishmat, metric = "Simpson")
```

## Main arguments
Each of the algorithms presented here has some specific parameters that can
be tweaked but some arguments are common for all the functions.  

Among these common arguments are the following:  
* `weight` a boolean indicating if the weights should be considered  
* `index` name or number of the column to use as weight. By default, the third
column name of the network data.frame is used  
* `site_col` name or number for the column of site nodes (i.e. primary nodes).  
* `species_col` = name or number for the column of species nodes (i.e. feature
nodes)  
* `return_node_type` a character indicating what types of nodes ("sites",
"species" or "both") should be returned in the output (keep_nodes_type="both"
by default).  
* `algorithm_in_output` a boolean indicating if the original output of
communities should be returned in the output (see Value).  

For the three algorithms relying on executable binary files, the following
arguments are needed:  
* `delete_temp` a boolean indicating if the temporary folder should be removed  
* `path_temp` a character indicating the path to the temporary folder  
* `binpath`	a character indicating the path to the bin folder  

# Binary files

```{r}
install_binaries(binpath = "tempdir", infomap_version = c("2.1.0", "2.6.0"))
```

## Infomap

@Rosvall2008

* `nbmod` penalize solutions the more they differ from this number (0 by
default for no preferred number of modules).  
* `markovtime` scales link flow to change the cost of moving between modules,
* higher values results in fewer modules (default is 1).  
* `seed` for the random number generator (NULL for random by default)  
* `numtrials` the number of trials before picking up the best solution.  
* `twolevel` a boolean indicating if the algorithm should optimize a two-level
partition of the network (default is multi-level).  
* `show_hierarchy` a boolean specifying if the hierarchy of community should be
identifiable in the outputs (FALSE by default).  

```{r}
set.seed(1)
ex_infomap <- netclu_infomap(fish_simil,
                             weight = TRUE,
                             index = names(fish_simil)[3],
                             nbmod = 0,
                             markovtime = 1,
                             seed = NULL,
                             numtrials = 1,
                             twolevel = FALSE,
                             show_hierarchy = FALSE,
                             directed = FALSE,
                             bipartite_version = FALSE,
                             bipartite = FALSE,
                             site_col = 1,
                             species_col = 2,
                             return_node_type = "both",
                             version = "2.6.0",
                             binpath = "tempdir",
                             path_temp = "infomap_temp",
                             delete_temp = TRUE)

table(ex_infomap$clusters$K_5)
```

## OSLOM
OSLOM stands for Order Statistics Local Optimization Method.

*Similarity-based* algorithm.

@Lancichinetti2011
`reassign` a string indicating if the nodes belonging to several community
should be reassign and what method should be used (see Note).  
* `r` the number of runs for the first hierarchical level (10 by default).  
* `hr` the number of runs for the higher hierarchical level (50 by default, 0
if you are not interested in hierarchies).  
* `seed` for the random number generator (NULL for random by default).  
* `t` the p-value, the default value is 0.10, increase this value you to get
more modules.  
* `cp` kind of resolution parameter used to decide between taking some modules
or their union (default value is 0.5, bigger value leads to bigger clusters).  

```{r, eval = FALSE}

ex_oslom <- netclu_oslom(fish_simil,
                         weight = TRUE,

                         seed = NULL,
                         t = 0.1,
                         cp = 0.5,
                         directed = FALSE,
                         bipartite = FALSE,

@Blondel2008

* `q` the quality function used to compute partition of the graph (modularity
is chosen by default, see Details).
* `c` the parameter for the Owsinski-Zadrozny quality function (between 0 and
1, 0.5 is chosen by default)
