## 0. Brief introduction

This tutorial aims at describing the different features of the R package
`bioregion`. 
The main purpose of the `bioregion`'s package is to propose a transparent 
methodological framework to compare bioregionalisation methods. Below is the 
typical flow chart of bioregions' identification based on a site-species 
bipartite network or co-occurrence matrix with `bioregion` (Figure 1). This
workflow can be divided into four main steps:

1. Preprocess the data (matrix or network formats)
2. Compute similarity/dissimilarity metrics between sites based on species
composition
3. Run the different algorithms to identify different set of bioregions
4. Evaluate and visualize the results

## 1. Install binary files

Some functions or at least part of them (listed below) require binary
files to run. 

* [netclu_infomap](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/netclu_infomap.html)
* [netclu_louvain](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/netclu_louvain.html) (Cpp version)
* [netclu_oslom](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/netclu_oslom.html)

Please check this 
[tutorial page](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a1_install_binary_files.html) 
to get instructions regarding the installation of the binary files.


## 2. Matrix or Network formats

The `bioregion`'s package takes as input site-species information stored in a 
bipartite network or a co-occurrence matrix. Relying on the function
[mat_to_net](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/mat_to_net.html)
and [net_to_mat](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/net_to_mat.html)
, it handles both the matrix and network formats throughout the workflow. 

Please have a look at this
[tutorial page](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a2_matrix_and_network_formats.html) 
to better understand how these two functions work.

## 3. Pairwise similarity/dissimilarity metrics

The functions [similarity](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/similarity.html) 
and [dissimilarity](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/dissimilarity.html)
compute respectively pairwise similarity and dissimilarity metrics based on a 
(site-species) co-occurrence matrix. The resulting `data.frame` is stored in a 
`bioregion.pairwise.metric` object containing all requested metrics between each 
pair of sites.

The functions [dissimilarity_to_similarity](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/dissimilarity_to_similarity.html) and [similarity_to_dissimilarity](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/reference/dissimilarity_to_similarity.html)
can be used to transform a similarity object into a dissimilarity object 
and vice versa.

Please have a look at this [tutorial page](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a3_pairwise_metrics.html) 
to better understand how these functions work.
 
## 4. Clustering algorithms

The `bioregion` R package gathers several methods allowing to group sites
and species into similar entities called bioregions. All these methods can lead
to several partitions of sites and species, i.e. to different
bioregionalizations.
<br>
Bioregionalization methods can be based on hierarchical clustering
algorithms, non-hierarchical clustering algorithms or network algorithms.
<br>
The functions in the package are related to each of these three families and
produce output that have a specific class, namely the `bioregion.clusters` 
class.
<br>

### 4.1 Hierarchical clustering

The functions relying on hierarchical clustering start with the prefix `hclu_`.
With these algorithms, the bioregions are placed into a dendrogram that ranges
from two extremes: all sites belong to the same bioregion (top of the tree) or
all sites belong to a different bioregion (bottom of the tree).  

See the following 
[tutorial page](https://biorgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a4_1_hierarchical_clustering.html) 
for more details.

### 4.2 Non-hierarchical clustering

The functions relying on hierarchical clustering start with the prefix 
`nhclu_`. For most of these algorithms, the user needs to predefine the number
of clusters, although this number can be determined by estimating the optimal
partition.

See this
[tutorial page](https://biorgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a4_2_non_hierarchical_clustering.html)
for more details.

### 4.3 Network clustering

The functions relying on network clustering start with the prefix `netclu_`.
Site-species matrices can be seen as (bipartite) networks where the nodes are
either the sites or the species and the links between them are the occurrences
of species within sites.  
With networks, modularity algorithms can be applied, leading to
bioregionalization.

The following 
[tutorial page](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a4_3_network_clustering.html) 
details more each clustering functions relying on a network algorithm.

### 4.4 Microbenchmark

The different bioregionalization methods listed in the package rely on more or
less computationally intensive algorithms.

The following [page](https://biorgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a4_4_microbenchmark.html)
estimates the time required to run each method on data sets of different sizes.

## 5. Visualization and evaluation of the results

If sites have geographic coordinates, then each bioregionalization can be
visualized with the function `map_clusters()`.

This [tutorial page](https://biorgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a5_visualization.html)
details different ways to plot your bioregionalization.
