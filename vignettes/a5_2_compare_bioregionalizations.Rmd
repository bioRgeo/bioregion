In this vignette, we aim at comparing the assignment of sites into different
bioregions across multiple bioregionalizations, using the function
`compare_bioregionalizations()`.

# 1. Data  
We use the vegetation dataset that comes with `bioregion`.

```{r}
data("vegedf")
data("vegemat")

# Calculation of (dis)similarity matrices
vegedissim <- dissimilarity(vegemat, metric = c("Simpson"))
vegesim <- dissimilarity_to_similarity(vegedissim)
```

# 2. Bioregionalization

We use the same three bioregionalization algorithms as in the
[visualization vignette](https://biorgeo.github.io/bioregion/articles/a5_visualization.html),
i.e. a non-hierarchical, hierarchical and network bioregionalizations.  
We chose 3 bioregions for the non-hierarchical and hierarchical
bioregionalizations.
<br>

```{r}
# Non hierarchical bioregionalization
vege_nhclu_kmeans <- nhclu_kmeans(vegedissim, n_clust = 3, index = "Simpson")
vege_nhclu_kmeans$cluster_info # 3

# Hierarchical bioregionalization
set.seed(1)
vege_hclu_hierarclust <- hclu_hierarclust(dissimilarity = vegedissim,
                                          method = "mcquitty", n_clust = 3,
                                          optimal_tree_method = "best")
vege_hclu_hierarclust$cluster_info # 3

# Network bioregionalization
set.seed(1)
vege_netclu_walktrap <- netclu_walktrap(vegesim,
                                        index = names(vegesim)[3])
vege_netclu_walktrap$cluster_info # 3
```

# 3. Compare the bioregionalizations 

Before comparing the bioregionalizations, we build a common `data.frame`
containing the three distinct bioregionalizations.
<br>

```{r}
comp <- dplyr::left_join(vege_hclu_hierarclust$clusters,
                         vege_netclu_walktrap$clusters,
                         by = "ID")
colnames(comp) <- c("ID", "K_3_hclu", "K_3_netclu")
comp <- dplyr::left_join(comp,
                         vege_nhclu_kmeans$clusters,
                         by = "ID")
colnames(comp) <- c("ID", "K_3_hclu", "K_3_netclu", "K_3_nhclu")

head(comp)
```

We can now run the function `compare_bioregionalizations()`.

```{r}
hclu_vs_netclu <- compare_bioregionalizations(
  bioregionalizations = comp[, c("K_3_hclu", "K_3_netclu", "K_3_nhclu")],
  store_pairwise_membership = TRUE,
  cor_frequency = TRUE,
  store_confusion_matrix = TRUE)

str(hclu_vs_netclu)
```

`compare_bioregionalizations()` produces several outputs which:
- look within each bioregionalization how sites are assigned to bioregions
- compare different bioregionalizations by analysing whether they produce
similar pairwise memberships

Let's first look at pairwise membership within bioregionalization.

## 3.1 Pairwise membership

The number of pairwise combinations for $n$ sites equals $n(n-1)/2$.
So in our case, where we have `r nrow(comp)` sites, we do end up with
`r nrow(comp)*(nrow(comp)-1)/2` pairwise combinations.

```{r}
nrow(hclu_vs_netclu$pairwise_membership) == nrow(comp)*(nrow(comp)-1)/2
```

Pairwise memberships look for each pairs of site whether they are assigned to
the same or to a different bioregion. Let's look at the sites 1 and 9 across
the different bioregionalization:

```{r}
comp[c(1, 9), ]
```

We can see that the sites 1 and 9 are classified in the same bioregion in the
first two bioregionalizations, but not in the third one.  
The `$pairwise_membership` output of `compare_bioregionalizations()` shows this
as a `TRUE/FALSE` statement.

```{r}
hclu_vs_netclu$pairwise_membership[8:10, ]
```

The number of times each pair of sites are clustered together (i.e. the sum of
rows of the table in `$pairwise_membership`) is available in the
`$freq_item_pw_membership` output:

```{r}
hclu_vs_netclu$freq_item_pw_membership[c(1, 8)]
```

The sites 1 and 2 were never classified in the same bioregion across the three
bioregionalizations. Sites 1 and 9 were classified in the same bioregion in
two bioregionalizations. If we look at the total frequencies:

```{r}
table(hclu_vs_netclu$freq_item_pw_membership)
```

we see that the most dominant situation is when sites are never assigned to
the same bioregion.

## 3.2 Confusion matrix

The confusion matrix allows to compare different bioregionalizations by looking
at the similarity of their pairwise memberships. To do so, the function
computes a confusion matrix with four elements:

. $a$ number of pairs of sites grouped in bioregionalization 1 and in
bioregionalization 2
. $b$ number of pairs of sites grouped in bioregionalization 1 but not in
bioregionalization 2
. $c$ number of pairs of sites not grouped in bioregionalization 1 but
grouped in bioregionalization 2
. $d$ number of pairs of sites not grouped in both bioregionalization 1 & 2

```{r}
hclu_vs_netclu$confusion_matrix
```

Based on the confusion matrices, we can compute a range of indices to indicate
the agreement among bioregionalizations. As of now, we have implemented:  
<br>
*Rand index* $(a+d)/(a+b+c+d)$ 
The Rand index measures agreement among bioregionalizations by accounting for
both the pairs of sites that are grouped, but also the pairs of sites that are
not grouped.  
<br>
*Jaccard index * $a/(a+b+c)$
The Jaccard index measures agreement among bioregionalizations by only
accounting for pairs of sites that are grouped.

These two metrics are complementary, because the Jaccard index will tell if
bioregionalizations are similar in their clustering structure, whereas the Rand
index will tell if bioregionalizations are similar not only in the pairs of
items clustered together, but also in terms of the pairs of sites that are not
clustered together. For example, take two bioregionalizations which never
group together the same pairs of sites. Their Jaccard index will be 0,
whereas the Rand index can be > 0 due to the sites that are not grouped
together.  

Additional indices can be manually computed by the users on the basis of the
list of confusion matrices.  

In some cases, users may be interested in finding which of the
bioregionalizations is most representative of all bioregionalizations To find
it out, we can compare the pairwise membership of each bioregionalization with
the total frequency of pairwise membership across all bioregionalizations.
This correlation can be requested with `cor_frequency = TRUE`.

```{r}
hclu_vs_netclu$bioregionalization_freq_cor
```

Here the third bioregionalization is the most representative of all
bioregionalizations.
